# Hilt Navigation Injection

An example of adding additional parameters to a view model that is injected using HILT. The project
structure is as follows:

| Package | Description|
|---------|------------|
| common  | Constants used within other packages|
| di| The dependency injection classses used with HILT|
| screen | The screen UI (```@Composable```) functions |
| viewmodel | The view models used by the screens.|

The navigation tree for this sample is contained within the ```MainActivity.kt``` class/file.

## How this all works

There is a Medium article for this so I will not repeat here.
